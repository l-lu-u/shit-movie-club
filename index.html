            <p>
                Shit Movie Club is a series of media student events at Aalto University where we meet monthly to watch films (with English subtitles) and discuss. It is a communal project, where everyone in the student community is welcome to watch, suggest, or organize the screening. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The movie club is initially started by Vertti and Burak in 2023 and currently continued by LÃ¹. This site is our collective record keeping. 
            </p>
            <h3>What have we explored?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>23</b> films in <b>16</b> months - something quirky, something camp, some of them are outstanding in many ways but still received "shit" reputation.
            </p>
            <h3>Thank you, DADA ðŸ¤Ž</h3>
            <p>
                Though we are not an official part of DADA (Media Lab student association), DADA board 2024 & 2023 have been warmly supporting our (quirky) endeavors.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Shit Movie Club" may seem to be the least "productive" project ever on Demo Day - but, we would like to shout out to the seemingly "unproductive" yet critical labor in this world: to build and care for community.
            </p>
